ac_012,Savart Bell and Resonator,James W. Queen & Co.,,"The hemispherical bell is made to vibrate by stroking it with a violin bow. If the resonating cylinder is turned toward the bell and its length adjusted by the slide until its resonate frequency matches that of the bell, the sound is intensified. The cylinder can be moved away from the bell and tilted up and down.

The plates could be made to vibrate, perhaps by stroking with a violin bow or tapping with a mallet, and the resulting sound examined. They could also be mounted with the plate horizontal. Then if a light powder, such as lycopodium powder, was placed on the plate, the nodes of standing waves in the plate when it was bowed or tapped could be seen in patterns of the powder.",Acoustics,,Display Case H3,,,,ac_056,,,,,,,https://collectionbuilder.blob.core.windows.net/objs/physics_museum/ac_056.jpg,https://collectionbuilder.blob.core.windows.net/smalls/physics_museum/ac_056_sm.jpg,https://collectionbuilder.blob.core.windows.net/thumbs/physics_museum/ac_056_th.jpg,,,

at_004,Electric Egg,James W. Queen & Co.,,"The electric egg is a glass vessel with an electrode at the top and another electrode at the bottom. At the bottom also is a tube with stopcock through which the air in the vessel can be pumped. It is used to demonstrate the production of light by a static electric charge. If the egg is evacuated and then a large static charge is place on the upper electrode, perhaps by connecting it to a static machine, a glow fills the egg. This was once suggested as a way to produce safe illumination in mines, but it was found that the glow does not persist long enough to be useful.

This instrument was sold by Queen & Co. but probably was manufactured in Europe.
