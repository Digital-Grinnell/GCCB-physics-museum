(""Astatic"" refers to the fact that the design minimizes the effect of the earth's magnetic field.)

It is used to measure quantity of charge rather than currents, for the large moment of inertia permits the passage of a quantity of charge before the coil moves significantly. The passage of the charge produces an impulse, a momentary torque, which causes the coil then to swing slowly to some maximum position. Such a galvanometer was often used to standardize capacitors.

em_054,Eight Leyden Jars in a Box,,,"The Leyden Jar was a sensational advancement for studies of electricity in the 18th century. A high voltage device made from simple materials, it was the first condenser, a precursor to the capacitor, storing electric energy until discharged. Such a device enabled a number of medical, engineering, and experimental applications. 
The Leyden Jar is a wide mouthed glass with metal wrapped around the outside and on the inside. The jar is filled with water or another liquid such as alcohol. A metal rod passes through the nonconductive top, reaching down to the liquid. When an electric charge is created (in this period, by an electrostatic friction machine) and somebody or a conductive object touches both the metal top of the rod and the outside metal, an electric shock jumps springs between the rod and the conductive agent, discharging the electricity stored in the jar's glass.
Two parties are credited with its invention, independently but around the same time: Ewald Georg von Kleist and Pieter van Musschenbroek, in 1745-1746. Musschenbroek and his assistant, Andreas Cunaeus, are given the namesake as they published their findings. It is named for the town and the University of Leiden, where they worked. Beyond its scientific merit, it was promoted commercially as a 'flask'  for wealthy people with scientific wonder.
The Leyden jars at Grinnell College are arranged in a box configuration, an advancement made by Benjamin Franklin in 1747-1748. This setup creates the ""Leyden Battery,"" allowing a stronger charge to be collectively built and stored. Such a design enabled the invention of the wireless telegraph at the beginning of the 20th century.

_________________________________________

A Leyden jar is a device made from a glass jar coated inside and out with metal sheets and a conducting rod inserted vertically through the jar to make contact with both the inner and outer sheets. The Leyden jar was the first form of a capacitor or condenser—a circuit device which stores electrical charge. It was independently designed by both the German deacon Ewald Georg von Kleist in 1744 and the Dutch scientists Pieter van Musschenbroek and Andreas Cunaeus in 1746 at the University of Leyden—hence its name. The development of the Leyden jar derives from an early conception of electricity as a fluid, wherein electricity was thought to be storable in containers using water or alcohol. Early attempts at storing electricity featured the conduction of electricity into a water-filled jar and discharging this electricity to the ground through a human interface. Successfully development allowed charging of the jar through the connection of one terminal of an electrostatic generator to the conducting rod and one to the outer foil. After charging, Leyden jars proved to be useful as portable sources of current through which experiments and demonstrations could be carried out, possibly in contexts where the use of an electrostatic generator is inconvenient and/or impossible. These particular Leyden jars are connected in parallel which allows for the storage of greater charge than an individual jar. This parallel connection was pioneered by Benjamin Franklin, who’s study of Leyden jars—and electricity in general—helped contribute the “drastic revision of the [electricity] fluid theory. . . and the first full paradigm for electricity” (Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, p. 62).

me_011,Magdeburg Hemispheres,James W. Queen & Co.,1885,"In 1654, Otto von Guericke, burgomaster of Magdeburg, performed an experiment using two brass hemispheres which fit together closely to make a sphere and which could be evacuated with a vacuum pump, which von Guericke had invented in 1650. Von Guericke used hemispheres about fourteen inches in diameter, and when as much air as possible had been pumped from them, two teams of horses could not pull the hemispheres apart.

The hemispheres shown here were purchased for $6.00 in 1885.

__________________________________________
Mayor Otto von Guericke of Magdeburg (1602-1686 AD) clearly had a flair for the dramatic. His scientific demonstrations involved props such as guillotines and strongmen. But his most famous public experiment at Regensburg sometime around 1654 (the exact date is uncertain) included what came to be known as the Magdeburg hemispheres. Made of copper or brass, the hemispheres can be joined to form a hollow globe. Using an air pump (which von Guericke also invented), he removed the air from the sphere and showed how 16 horses – 2 teams of 8 each – could not pull the halves apart. The sphere immediately fell apart once air was reintroduced. From this experiment, he showed that the air pressure surrounding the hemispheres, without the counteraction of the pressure normally existing inside the sphere when it was filled with air, made them cling together. Scientists were just beginning to realize that we live under an ocean of air, with the mass of the atmosphere corresponding to a pressure of about 1 kg per cm2. The discovery of the sheer force of the pressure of the atmosphere led to the development of the first steam engines in the 1700s. 

Although the 1600s were a tumultuous time in Magdeburg’s history, von Guericke still found time to contemplate various questions about the nature of space. Aristotle (384-322 BC) proposed that “nature abhors a vacuum,” currently defined as any volume with a lower particle density and gas pressure than the surrounding atmosphere. This postulate would be believed for almost 2000 years. Evangelista Torricelli (1608-1647 AD), one of von Guericke’s contemporaries, demonstrated in 1643 that a vacuum could exist in space above an enclosed column of mercury. However, from astronomical observation of the constancy of the time it took for planets to revolve, von Guericke concluded that space is also a vacuum without friction. He also conducted experiments on the elasticity of air, as well as the relation of air pressure and altitude. Combined with Blaise Pascal’s discovery of the link between atmospheric pressure and weather, von Guericke proposed meteorological stations to gather data to forecast the weather. Other discoveries he is credited with include the magnetization of iron, the invention of a static electricity generator, and the observation of colored shadows.

In 1654, Otto von Guericke was credited for inventing the first Vacuum pump. It was not until 1660 that Robert Boyle published his New Experiments in which he describes his theory of air pressure (Brush, 13). His theory would then become known as Boyle’s Law in which the volume and absolute pressure of a contained gas are inversely proportional. Until the 17th century, air was an invisible substance that could not be studied or explained. With the invention of the Vacuum pump, the principles of air could not only be studied, but they could be demonstrated in such a way that was ultimately undeniable (Brundtland, 265). This type of demonstration not only depicted scientific discovery, but also commanded a certain amount of excitement. Well into the late 1700’s and early 1800’s, experiments continued in the realms of sound, electricity, and mechanics (Brundtland, 267). 
	Grinnell College bought a vacuum pump in 1885 for 25$ from a fairly well known manufacturer of scientific instruments known as Queen & co. This pump is a single barrel pump with a standard sealable bell jar. Air can be evacuated from the jar by pumping the handle (now missing) up and down.

me_207,Rolling Double Cone,,,"The rolling double cone serves as a demonstration of how gravity acts on an object’s center of mass. When released, the edges of the rolling double cone appear to move up its triangular support, but in reality the cone’s center of mass is still rolling downwards. The concept of the center of mass is older than the rolling double cone, which seems to have become a popular instrument in the 1700s. Some early versions of the cone were less elegantly constructed from rulers and screws, and could produce results that were unreliable. Nevertheless, its simplicity made it a useful and easy-to-understand demonstration when well carried out, and it was well-known in England by the eighteenth century. Several textbooks and course outlines from that time period cite it as one of the more important phenomena to be understood when it came to understanding laws of gravity and motion. The rolling double cone experiment was used in classrooms and illustrated and explained in textbooks to help explain to students how gravity worked. It is still being used in introductory physics classes at Grinnell today, as a way of demonstrating the importance of the concept of center of mass, and to show how counterintuitive it can be.

te_043,Surveyor’s Transit Serial No. 7969,Young & Sons,,"A surveyor’s transit is used to measure horizontal and vertical angles (The Surveyor’s Basic Tools).  It was invented in 1831 by William J. Young. Designs varied throughout the 1800s, but were generally standardized by 1885. The transit was a highly versatile tool and with modifications was used not only for surveying, but also for astronomy, mining, and tunneling (Beeks). 
	Young & Sons made this specific surveyor’s transit in the United States sometime between 1906 and 1908 (Miller). It likely came to Grinnell to be used in the class “Surveying and Plotting”, offered from 1905 to 1909, and then in the class simply titled “Surveying” from 1910 to 1923 after which the class was no longer offered. The transit was likely used directly by students and not just professors for demonstration as the course description says it is about “the theory of different instruments and practice in their use” as well as that students should expect to perform six hours of field work each week. Some of the earlier descriptions of the course explicitly mentioning using the transit during the first half of the course, and although the transit is no longer explicitly mentioned in some of the later course descriptions it is still likely that it was included in the instruments used for field work (Grinnell College Catalogs).

te_072,Chronograph,Fauth & Co.,1888,"The chronograph was used in conjuction with a transit telescope to make a correction to a clock. The drum was covered with a sheet of paper, and a pen-holding mechanism, now lost, moved along the length of the drum as the drum rotated. The pen made a continuous line on the paper. The pen mechanism was connected to a clock which put out an electrical pulse every second, and those pulses made jogs in the line. An observer at a transit telescope watched for the passage of a star through the meridian, and when the star crossed the cross-hairs of the telescope, the observer closed a switch which produced a different sort of jog in the line. It was then possible to determine within a small fraction of a second what the clock read when the star crossed the meridian. The drum was turned by a spring motor, and the governor to control the speed is in the upper right of the picture. This was part of the equipment in the Grinnell College observatory in the late 1800s.",Technology,,Display Case F2,,,,te_072,,,,,,,https://collectionbuilder.blob.core.windows.net/objs/physics_museum/te_072.jpg,https://collectionbuilder.blob.core.windows.net/smalls/physics_museum/te_072_sm.jpg,https://collectionbuilder.blob.core.windows.net/thumbs/physics_museum/te_072_th.jpg,,,

This box contains a flash, a timer, and a mounting point to hold the camera and original photograph exactly in place. The exposure time of the copy is much longer than for the original image. Images that were taken under- or over-exposed can be fixed in copying by exposing for different amounts of time. The manual reccomends an exposure time of up to 25 seconds to improve a very under-exposed image, and an exposure time as little as 4 seconds to slightly darken an over-exposed image.

te_291,Transit Telescope,Fauth & Co.,,"A Transit Telescope is the basic instrument for determining time by stars. It is fixed such that the instrument rotates on its axis in a north-south plane.1 An observer using the transit telescope watches a chosen star pass across the cross-hairs. These time measurements probably provided time base for the Haish telescope in the Goodnow observatory and did provide time for the Rock Island railroad.
This Fauth Transit Telescope was purchased by the college in 1888 for a concessional price of $550.   The transit telescope (in Noyce Hall foyer), chronograph (in display case F2), astronomical Seth Thomas clocks (in Kistle Science Library), and micrometer (in case F2) were purchases requested by Samuel J. Buck following the construction of the Goodnow observatory with its Haish telescope. “If a man makes you a present of a fine horse, immediately you begin looking about for a saddle and bridle, harness, carriage and sleigh in order to make use of the horse,”
The transit telescope is the basic instrument for determining time by stars. The axis of a transit telescope is fixed in the east west direction so that when the instrument moves, it moves only up and down in a north-south plane. This one was mounted on a Y shaped metal base and located in the brick transit house just East of Goodnow. It was reported to have an objective with aperture of 3 inches and three eye pieces, a direct, diagonal, and a nadir, with approximate powers of 50, 100, and 30, respectively.  An observer would watch a chosen star pass across the cross-hairs. The time between one passage of a star and the next is one sidereal day. The interval between two successive passages of the sun past some fixed point in the sky, such as the meridian, is one solar day, and it is 3 minutes 56 seconds longer than the sidereal day. Because the observations of stars are made at night, the cross-hairs must be illuminated. The cross-hairs are in the center of the telescope tube, and a window at each end of the support admitted light from a kerosene lamp to make the cross-hairs visible. From a knowledge of the longitude of the observatory and the location in the sky of a particular star, one can calculate precisely the time at which that star passes the local meridian. If the passage is observed with the transit telescope, the derived time can be used to set a clock or, more likely, produce a correction to be applied to the clock’s reading. It is easier to use corrections than to set clocks frequently.",Technology,,,,,,te_291,,,,,,,https://collectionbuilder.blob.core.windows.net/objs/physics_museum/te_291.jpg,https://collectionbuilder.blob.core.windows.net/smalls/physics_museum/te_291_sm.jpg,https://collectionbuilder.blob.core.windows.net/thumbs/physics_museum/te_291_th.jpg,,,
